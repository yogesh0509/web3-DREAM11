# Web3-DREAM11

## Overview

Web3-DREAM11 is a decentralized fantasy sports platform that leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and Chainlink oracles to enhance transparency, fairness, and user trust. By migrating core game logic onto the Ethereum blockchain, the platform ensures that all actions—from player registration to prize distribution—are immutable, auditable, and free from centralized manipulation.

  - Utilizes Chainlink oracles to securely transmit real-time player statistics and rankings to smart contracts, safeguarding against data manipulation.
  - Ensures secure data storage on the blockchain, fostering transparency and user trust.

- **Equal Opportunity:**
  - Allocates an equal amount of Dream Tokens to each team upon registration, eradicating unfair advantages.
  - Introduces skill-based player selection through live auctions, exempt from gambling laws, fostering healthy competition.

- **Chainlink Automation:**
  - Employs Chainlink automation for automated auctions, ensuring transparency and fairness.

- **Live Auctions and Game Determination:**
